This project is an incomplete work in progress project with some inital functionality.


- 8 servos
- Arduino Uno
- PCA9685 servo with afruit 16-channel PWM & Servo driver


Even if the hardware is not exactly the same, things should work overall with a few tweaks.

In my hardware I have 2 push buttons and one potentiometer.

Each button has 2 modes.
Button A:

1. position of servo
2. selection of servo

Button B:

1. Records servo id and position of that servo
2. Recording playback (commented out at the moment - basic walk cycle is there now)
